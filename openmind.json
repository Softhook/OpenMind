The prototype is “haunted” by the plundered cultural traces, distortions, and echoes the AI introduces.\r\n3.\tPlay and Reflect\r\nEngage critically and emotively with the prototype. Attend to what it evokes, how it assembles or unsettles cultural contexts, and the tensions or resonances that surface.\r\n4.\tRe-prompt to hone\r\nCraft a new prompt that builds on these insights. The aim is to hone or intensify the haunted aspects by deliberately reworking fragments drawn from the prototype.\r\n5 Saturation and Boredom\r\nIdentify when no more novelty emerges and stop to move on.\r\n",
