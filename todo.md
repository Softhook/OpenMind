When copying text into the application you need to sanitize it to remove strange characters or hidden characters. 

Try and get the bold working 

It'd be nice if the boxes shrank automatically to the minimum size needed horizontally when there is  only a single line of text

add a timed outosave

add a dashed line connection

reflow text boxes based on connections

Center a loaded file after load 

Selecting a few boxes and then using 'a' line should try and horizontally or vertically align the edges of all the boxes 

pressing s key make all the selected boxes the same width of possible

While typing or coppying text in once is get over 10 words then do the line break
