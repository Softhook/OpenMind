      "text": "So, what does this paper tell us about the future of living with AI? Very little—and that’s intentional. It’s trying to understand what working with AI means in late 2025. This implies this study will need to be repeated as a continuous practice of engaging with the gen AI of the moment. Rather than speculating about the future, Plundergeist proposes a practice of engaging with AI that treats it not as something radically new, but as a medium can be interrogated using established methods native to art and design.\r\n\r\nThe paper has argued for self-reflective practice as a productive method for investigating AI in design. It identifies generative AI as introducing distinctive affordances that disrupt and reconfigure design practice, highlighting its world-making potential. AI is presented as a inherently unstable entity—very different from the dominant media framings that focus on hallucinations and binary notions of legitimacy that try to rein in the waywardness of AI. Crucially, the notion of creating through archetypes is shown to be a productive way of working with AI, rooted in a history of cultural sampling and plundering. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that this kind of pragmatically focused, self-reflective engagement with gen AI is particularly valuable in design education. It enables educators to move beyond narratives of fear and replacement. I have used this approach in my undergraduate design course to demonstrate that AI is not something to be feared, but a “difference engine”—a technology that opens playful, world-building possibilities rather than closing them down. Framing AI as a continuation of existing design engagements with new media has proven empowering for students. Notably, it led to high quality work and no cases of plagiarism where AI use was not cited. This paper argues that such reflective practices enrich design pedagogy by positioning generative AI as an experimental medium, rather than merely a tool for efficiency or speculative rhetoric.\r\n ",
