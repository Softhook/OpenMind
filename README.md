# OpenMind - Mind Mapping Software

A simple mind mapping application built with p5.js.

## Features

- Create and edit nodes with auto-resizing text boxes
- Move nodes, resize via the bottom-right circular handle, and multi-select
- Multi-select & group drag: toggle selection with Shift, then drag from a selected box edge to move as a group
- Create connections between boxes; drag a connectionâ€™s arrowhead to reattach to a different box
- Reverse a connection via Space (when selected)
- Copy/Paste nodes (Cmd/Ctrl+C, Cmd/Ctrl+V) at the cursor location
- Delete selected nodes or connections (Backspace/Delete)
- Undo (Cmd/Ctrl+Z)
- Pan and zoom the entire view, reset to fit
- Export PNG, PDF, and Text
- Save/Load maps as JSON files
   - On Chromium-based browsers (Chrome/Edge), Save opens a system Save As dialog (File System Access API)
   - On other browsers, it downloads to your default Downloads folder

## How to Use
