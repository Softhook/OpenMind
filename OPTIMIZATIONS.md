# OpenMind Optimization Summary

This document details all the optimizations applied to the OpenMind mind mapping application.

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Text Wrapping Cache
**Location**: `TextBox.js`
**Impact**: High - Reduces redundant text calculations on every frame

- Added `cachedWrappedLines` and `cachedWidth` properties to TextBox
- Cache is invalidated only when text or width changes
- Wrapped text lines are now computed once and reused until invalidation
- Significantly reduces CPU usage during rendering

### 2. Configuration Constants
**Location**: All files
**Impact**: Medium - Improves maintainability and consistency

#### sketch.js
- Created `CONFIG` object with centralized constants:
  - `ZOOM`: MIN (0.2), MAX (3.0), STEP (1.05)
  - `CAMERA`: PAN_MARGIN (500)
  - `UI`: TOOLBAR_HEIGHT, MENU_TRIGGER_X/Y, BUTTON positioning
  - `EXPORT`: PADDING (50), MARGIN (20)

#### TextBox.js
- Converted all magic numbers to static constants:
  - `PADDING = 15`
  - `MIN_WIDTH = 80`, `MIN_HEIGHT = 40`, `MAX_WIDTH = 300`
  - `FONT_SIZE = 14`
  - `CORNER_RADIUS = 10`
  - `DELETE_ICON_SIZE = 20`, `RESIZE_HANDLE_SIZE = 12`
  - `CURSOR_BLINK_RATE = 530`
  - `DRAG_EDGE_THICKNESS = 16`
  - `COLOR_CIRCLE_RADIUS = 8`, `COLOR_CIRCLE_SPACING = 10`
  - `LINE_HEIGHT_MULTIPLIER = 1.5`

#### Connection.js
- Added static constants:
  - `ARROW_SIZE = 10`
  - `HIT_THRESHOLD = 5`
  - `STROKE_WEIGHT_NORMAL = 2`, `STROKE_WEIGHT_SELECTED = 3`

#### MindMap.js
- Added configuration constants:
  - `MAX_UNDO_STACK = 20` (increased from 5)
  - `ALIGN_TOLERANCE = 12`

### 3. Memory Management
**Location**: `MindMap.js`
**Impact**: High - Prevents memory leaks

- Increased undo stack from 5 to 20 snapshots for better UX
- Implemented proper cleanup in `fromJSON()` to clear references
- Added explicit `selectedBoxes.clear()` call when loading
- Deep cloning of undo snapshots to prevent reference issues
- Proper array management to prevent unbounded growth

### 4. Debounced Window Resize
**Location**: `sketch.js`
**Impact**: Medium - Reduces computational load during window resize

- Added `RESIZE_DEBOUNCE_MS = 16` (approximately 60fps)
- Window resize operations are throttled to prevent expensive recalculations
- Improves performance when dragging window edges

### 5. Dirty Flagging System
**Location**: `MindMap.js`
**Impact**: Medium - Enables future optimizations

- Added `isDirty` flag to track when content changes
- Set to `true` when boxes are added/removed or connections change
- Provides foundation for conditional rendering optimizations

### 6. Line Height Consistency
**Location**: All files
**Impact**: Low - Improves consistency and maintainability

- Replaced all hardcoded `fontSize * 1.5` calculations
- Now uses `TextBox.LINE_HEIGHT_MULTIPLIER` constant
- Ensures consistent line spacing throughout the application

## Code Organization Improvements

### 1. Function Extraction
**Location**: `sketch.js`

- Created `setupUIButtons()` function to separate UI setup from main setup
- Improves readability and maintainability
- Makes setup() function more concise

### 2. Error Handling
**Location**: All files

#### sketch.js
- Added try-catch block around entire `setup()` function
- Enhanced `handleFileLoad()` with comprehensive validation:
  - File existence check
  - File type validation
  - Data structure validation
  - JSON parsing error handling
  - User-friendly error messages

#### MindMap.js
- Enhanced `pushUndo()` with deep cloning
- Better error messages in all methods
- Graceful degradation on errors

#### TextBox.js & Connection.js
- Existing error handling maintained and enhanced
- All validation checks properly implemented

### 3. Color Palette Method
**Location**: `TextBox.js`

- Extracted color palette into static `getColorPalette()` method
- Reduces memory usage (single definition instead of per-instance)
- Makes palette customization easier

## Validation Improvements

### Enhanced Input Validation
**Location**: All files

1. **File Loading**: Validates file type, data structure, and content
2. **Mouse Coordinates**: All mouse handlers check for valid/finite coordinates
3. **Box Data**: JSON loading validates all required fields with fallbacks
4. **Connection Data**: Validates box references exist before creating connections

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Added "Performance Optimizations" section
- Documents key optimizations for users and developers
- Lists specific improvements

### OPTIMIZATIONS.md (this file)
- Comprehensive documentation of all changes
- Categorized by impact level
- Technical details for future maintainers

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimizations
- Text wrapping calculated on every frame
- No caching of expensive operations
- Undo limited to 5 snapshots
- Magic numbers scattered throughout code
- Window resize caused lag

### After Optimizations
- Text wrapping cached and reused
- Debounced resize operations
- Undo expanded to 20 snapshots
- Centralized configuration
- Improved memory management
- Better error handling prevents crashes

## Future Optimization Opportunities

1. **Spatial Partitioning**: Implement quadtree for faster mouse hit detection
2. **Incremental Rendering**: Only redraw changed elements using dirty flags
3. **Web Workers**: Offload heavy computations (text wrapping, exports)
4. **Canvas Layers**: Separate static and dynamic content into layers
5. **Request Animation Frame**: Better frame timing control
6. **Virtual Scrolling**: For very large mind maps (1000+ nodes)
7. **IndexedDB**: Persist undo history across sessions

## Breaking Changes
None - All optimizations are backward compatible with existing saved files.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Load large mind maps (50+ boxes) and verify smooth performance
2. Test undo/redo with 20+ operations
3. Verify all export functions (PNG, PDF) work correctly
4. Test window resize during active editing
5. Verify text wrapping accuracy with various box sizes
6. Test memory usage over extended sessions

## Conclusion

These optimizations significantly improve the performance, maintainability, and user experience of OpenMind while maintaining full backward compatibility. The codebase is now more organized, easier to modify, and better prepared for future enhancements.
